# Automate detection of different sentiments from textual comments and feedback
Developed a deep learning algorithm for sentiment analysis using IMDB movie reviews data. The process involved data
preprocessing, cleaning, training, and testing to build an accurate model for detecting various sentiments. Leveraged Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques and implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify sentiment types
effectively from the text data.
